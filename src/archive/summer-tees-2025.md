description: The execution of our first t-shirts started back in 2022. An idea
  that started in 2018 in a private closed account was finally shown to the
  public. It sounded terrifying to open up to the world so I kept sharing my
  research and development to f&f only. All those years to take up some courage
  were actually ideal. It left a lot of room for maturing creatively, there was
  simply no pressure at all. 2022 was a year of dramatic progress, the first
  t-shirt was designed. A limited run of 30 tshirts were screen printed locally
