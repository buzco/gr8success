    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    Have you ever felt like you’re supposed to have it all figured out — always confident, always in control? We believe there’s beauty in the opposite. At Buzco, we celebrate the messy, honest, deeply human side of life. We make little reminders that it’s okay to stumble, to question, to laugh at yourself, and to keep going anyway. Because being human is more than enough.

    <h4>Our muse</h4>
    <a>We draw heavy inspiration from our main three pillars: Science, Nature, and Spirituality. It’s the balance between the rationality of science and the intuition of spirituality that propels our ideas forward — a space where human existence finds meaning in both reason and wonder. Nature is where we always come back — our roots, our teacher, the place that reminds us what’s real. The world keeps trying to glue us to screens and constant noise, but we crave a slower, more grounded way of living. We’re not against technology, but the way it’s designed now mostly drains us. We want it to serve us, not swallow us — to support life, not replace it. </a>

  <h4>Gr8 Success, what's that?</h4>
  <a>Gr8 success is an alternative way of looking at success. It’s not about status or chasing more — it’s about what truly matters. It’s the journey inward, learning to feel safe and whole within ourselves. It’s about growing past the old stories we believed about who we are, and gently rewriting them into something truer.
    
  <p>We aspire to create souvenirs that remind people of their human condition in a blissful way, as a token of confidence and self-acceptance. Gr8 success is achieving authenticity, it is admitting to yourself that sometimes you can feel nervous when you are about to order a coffee, and you're afraid of looking clumsy while doing it. It's that inevitable inner chat that needs to be soothed <3 </p>
