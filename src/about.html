    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    Have you ever felt like you’re supposed to have it all figured out - always confident, always in control? How many times have we pressured ourselves into this state? We tell ourselves if we don't behave, act, or look a certain way (usually optimally), things won't flow. Rationally we see this line of thought is just silly, however we still do it to ourselves. The consequence of pressuring ourselves is losing access to our most unique parts and nuances - they are just hidden from others, and mainly yourslef. Just like the hidden side of the moon, what's deep in the sea, or what we still haven't discovered in this vast universe, we want to know more about those hidden parts, by actively chasing that as the end goal. Curiosity is powerful, it is a driving force that we deem essential in this passing - it's how we access our inner hidden self treasures, and its how we connect to the world surrounding us. That's brings us to our next point - Our muse.

    <h4>Our muse</h4>
    <a>Our creative expression strongly manifests in two ways: through Science and Spirituality, Rationality and Intuition, you see? Both share common ground with our core subject - Nature! It's this balance that shapes our ideas and creations. Science is a human concept created to evaluate and worship Nature on an observational and rational way. On the other hand, Spirituality is nuanced, subjective and personal, divine, focuses on the unseen. The most interesting part for us is that our human experience is often balancing between these two!</a>

<h4>Gr8 Success, what's that?</h4>
  <a>Gr8 success is an alternative way of looking at success. It’s not about status or chasing more - It’s that journey inward, learning to feel safe and whole within ourselves. It's when our self perception begins to change for the better.
    
  <p>We aspire to share our creations and resonate with other humans that feel just the same way. Who are maybe on their own journey. We see great value in connecting with other people through this channel, and we're excited to get to know more people this way. </p>
