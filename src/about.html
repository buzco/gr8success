    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    At Buzco we provide souvenirs for people who need that little reminder of encouragement to go on with their lives, free of judgement, to remind them its okay to be goofy and human. We just want people to feel enough, okay?

    <h4>Our muse</h4>
    <a>We draw heavy inspiration from souvenir shops, museum merchandise, scientific illustrations, science and nature books, encyclopedias, and nature itself. We aspire to communicate our views of life with graphic elements from these sources</a>

  <h4>Gr8 Success, what's that?</h4>
  <a>Gr8 success is an abbreviation for our interpretation of life and human existence. We believe that there is a colossal elephant in the room in what regards vulnerability and the display of it, therefore we believe that it needs to be normalized, talked about, joked about, accepted, and celebrated. 
    
  <p>We aspire to create souvenirs that remind people of their human condition in a blissful way, as a token of confidence and self-acceptance. Gr8 success is achieving authenticity, it is admitting to yourself that sometimes you can feel nervous when you are about to order a coffee, and you're afraid of looking clumsy while doing it. It's that inevitable inner chat that needs to be soothed <3</p>
